📊 Smart Logistics Optimization System: Baseline DashboardProject OverviewThis project serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating data-driven project analysis and front-end KPI reporting capabilities. The core objective is to establish a Baseline for key operational metrics in a simulated logistics environment and track progress toward a target reduction goal.The interactive dashboard is the primary deliverable for Phase 1: Baseline Data Foundation & KPI Reporting.🎯 Key Project GoalThe primary business objective is to achieve a 10% reduction in the Average Delivery Time (ADT) and overall operational distance, driven by the future deployment of a predictive logistics model (Phase 2).✨ FeaturesReal-time KPI Tracking: Displays and dynamically calculates performance metrics against a defined 10% reduction target.Dynamic Data Input: Users can instantly update the current performance values (ADT and AD) to simulate real-world weekly results.Performance Visualization: A simulated line chart tracks the performance trend, visually comparing the current metric against the fixed target baseline.Bilingual Support (i18n): Features a language selector supporting English, Persian (Farsi), and Arabic, including full RTL (Right-to-Left) layout adjustments.Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)The system tracks two primary metrics:MetricDescriptionBaseline ValueTarget (10% Reduction)ADTAverage Delivery Time (minutes)35.0 min31.5 minADAverage Distance Traveled (kilometers)8.0 km7.2 kmThe progress bar on the dashboard visually indicates current performance relative to the defined 10% reduction target.🛠️ Technology StackThe dashboard is built using a minimal, high-performance web stack:HTML5: Structural foundation.Tailwind CSS: For highly responsive, utility-first styling and rapid aesthetic development.JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles all dynamic logic, metric updates, performance calculations, and internationalization (i18n).Chart.js: Used for rendering the responsive and interactive time-series performance graph.🚀 Setup and UsageSince this project is contained within a single HTML file, setup is straightforward.Clone or Download: Save the logistics_dashboard.html file to your local machine.Open in Browser: Simply double-click the file to open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).The dashboard will load immediately, allowing you to interact with the language selector and the data input fields.
